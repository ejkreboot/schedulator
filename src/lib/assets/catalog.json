Students will learn how individuals with disabilities have had to actively campaign for civil rights and legal protections, and how that struggle continues to shape communities impacted by disabilities. Two interconnected foci of the course are (1) how individuals with disabilities have been regularly and systematically excluded from their communities, and (2) how the inclusion of individuals in a community is good for the community itself.

On this alternative view, we human beings are first and foremost desiring, yearning, craving, longing, hungering beings. The alternative view has its roots in Saint Augustine who, in the 4th century, famously said, “You have made us for yourself, O God, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.” Our hearts are restless.They’re agitated.

We will also investigate the influence and leadership of the Church Reformers in four European countries. The best way to understand these famous scientists and reformers and their contributions to psychology, religion and leadership is to see where they lived, breathed and worked, thereby permitting a greater appreciation of how their culture and contexts shaped their viewpoints, theories and practice. Through this experience, we expect our students to articulate the central contributions of each psychologist and reformer studied, but more importantly, understand how the cultural and historical context shaped these theoretical perspectives and what that means for a student of psychology, business, and religion today. Furthermore, we hope our students will develop cultural agility which will allow them to understand when to integrate culturally diverse norms, practices, or perspectives. Understanding and adapting to these cultural differences can be crucial for leadership, organizational effectiveness, and success. Prerequisite(s): PSYC 151 and one religion course.",

The unit of analysis undergirding the course is the actions of individuals or groups within organizations, especially actors’ messages and symbolic interactions, as well as the behavior of entire organizations or sets of organizations. Although organizations are such an ever-present, taken-for-granted aspect of our lives, you may not have developed a full understanding of them. For this reason, this course includes activities and assignments designed to enhance appreciation and analysis of organizations and organizational communication. The course also addresses competencies needed to communicate effectively in organizations and those skills useful for aiding others in organizations to attain personal and organizational goals.",

We will treat colonial America as a cluster of distinct socio-cultural regions: plantation Virginia, Caribbean Carolina, Puritan New England, commercial mid-Atlantic, and the Scots-Irish backcountry. These regions converged to sustain a successful war against the British, but almost fell apart again during the first decades of independence. We will pay special attention to the unexpected dynamics of the Revolutionary War and to the Constitution as establishing an arena of combat rather than a set of settled answers.

As China has sought to modernize over the last half century, some of its traditions and practices have persisted, while others have become Westernized. Part of a two-thousand-year-old tradition is the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which is still as vibrant today as in history. TCM, with its practice in acupuncture and herbal remedies, is becoming more and more recognized and popular in Western societies, including the US and Europe. With a holistic approach, TCM focuses more on improving the body’s natural ways of healing rather than combating diseases directly. Knowledge about and familiarity with TCM has increasing values for future healthcare professionals as well as for anyone interested in improving their own health. Half of this course focuses on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and the other half focuses on Chinese culture. Students will learn about Chinese history, philosophy, and culture in this class. China has a five-thousand-year-long recorded history with rich and distinctive cultures. As China becomes more and more influential on the global stage, an understanding of Chinese values and culture is increasingly important. When this course is offered off campus, students will learn TCM from a medical school in China and travel and explore various cities and cultural sites in China. When this course is offered on campus, students will learn from instructor(s) on campus and have field trips to Chinese restaurant, stores, churches, and Chicago Chinatown. In either case, students will experience Chinese culture firsthand. The course consists of lectures, discussions, presentations, an independent project, and trips.",

    "description": "This course will explore restorative justice and the ideas that form its foundation, question its strengths and shortcomings, examine restorative practices , and investigate opportunities to put the theory into practice. Moreover, we will finetune our exploration of restorative justice from a religious point of view, and more specifically from a Christian point of view. We will note that several world religions provide a vision of what we are calling “restorative justice,” and that Christianity puts a fine point on restorative justice as a form of “reconciliation.” We will further explore how the church models a type of “commmunity of reconciliation” and as a model can inform how we might want to shape other social spaces into communities of restorative justice and reconciliation. For sections taught for the Calvin Prison Initiative, the social space we will consider is the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility. To that end, we will briefly take up issues of crime and punishment in the United States and relocate them in the realm of restorative justice and communities of reconciliation. On the Knollcrest campus, the social space we will consider is a local neighborhood or community context.",
